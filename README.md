# Introduction

treesit-stickyscroll is a modified (and simplified) version of [treesitter-context](https://github.com/zbelial/treesitter-context.el). treesit-stickyscroll keeps off-screen contextual infomation in 'sticky' headers with [posframe](https://github.com/tumashu/posframe), at top of window, to simulate sticky scroll feature found in other editors like Xcode.

Language support

  - C
  - C++

> Note: the original treesitter-context supports a lot more languages. But I have only updated C & C++ tree sitter query to work with treesit-stickyscroll. If you would like to use treesit-stickyscroll in other languages, look for language definitions in treesitter-context, which should work with minimal change.
